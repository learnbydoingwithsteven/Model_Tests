# AI Model Tests and Experiments

This repository contains a series of experiments and tests focused on fine-tuning, quantizing, and evaluating various language models (LLMs, MLLMs, etc.).

## About This Project

This repository serves as a collection of hands-on examples and explorations into the practical aspects of working with AI models. The projects cover a range of topics, including:

*   **Model Fine-Tuning:** Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks and datasets.
*   **Model Quantization:** Techniques for reducing model size and improving inference speed.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Profiling and comparing the performance of different models.

## Projects

The repository is organized into several project directories, each focusing on a specific test or experiment. Please refer to the `README.md` file within each project's folder for detailed information and instructions.
